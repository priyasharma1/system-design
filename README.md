# system-design

Hello everyone, recently I started exploring more about system design.
And the amount of information baffled me. There are a lot a sources, everyone claiming to be masters.
But when your actually try to think about the concepts explained, it is still very superficial for a novice to even connect, forget implementing.

But the deeper I dived what I could understand was these concepts are everywhere, we are probably using many of them. 
Its just that we are not accostumed to the terminologies.

Thus I am creating this repo to pen down my understanding and discuss all naive questions I face in my journey.


It is day 1 and I just know some basic terminologies about the topic.

System design is a trending topic these days, most famous companies have a system design round and overall it seems to be a must skill in your skill set


Primary concepts that constitutes system design are : 

Scalability
Fault Tolerance
Load Balancing
Caching
Availability

It also demands you to have through knowledge of basic design principles -
microservices
sharding
event sourcing
circuit breaker
reverse proxy
backpressure
CQRS
Object Pool

Familarity with diffrent types of databses :

relational 
nosql
distributed key-value store
document databases
graph databases
time series databases

Distributed system algorithm

merkle tree
consistent hashing
read repair
gossip protocol
bloom filter
heartbeat
CAP and PaceLc theorem
